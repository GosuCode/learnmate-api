# TF-IDF Implementation for LearnMate

This document describes the custom TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) implementation integrated into the LearnMate backend for intelligent content summarization and analysis.

## üéØ Overview

The TF-IDF algorithm is a statistical method used to evaluate the importance of words in a document relative to a collection of documents. In LearnMate, we use it to:

- **Generate intelligent summaries** by identifying the most important sentences
- **Extract key points** from content
- **Categorize content** based on keyword analysis
- **Provide detailed text analysis** for educational insights

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **`TFIDFService`** (`src/services/tfidfService.ts`)
   - Main service class implementing the TF-IDF algorithm
   - Handles text preprocessing, scoring, and analysis

2. **`AIService`** (`src/services/aiService.ts`)
   - Integrates TF-IDF with external AI services
   - Provides fallback summarization when external APIs are unavailable

3. **`aiController`** (`src/controllers/aiController.ts`)
   - HTTP endpoints for TF-IDF functionality
   - Handles request/response formatting

## üîß Algorithm Implementation

### 1. Text Preprocessing

```typescript
private tokenize(text: string): string[] {
  return text
    .toLowerCase()
    .replace(/[^\w\s]/g, '') // Remove punctuation
    .split(/\s+/)
    .filter(word => word.length > 0)
    .filter(word => !this.stopWords.has(word)); // Remove stop words
}
```

**Features:**

- Converts to lowercase
- Removes punctuation
- Filters out stop words (common words like "the", "and", "is")
- Handles whitespace normalization

### 2. Sentence Splitting

```typescript
private splitSentences(text: string): string[] {
  const sentences = text
    .replace(/([.!?])\s*(?=[A-Z])/g, '$1|') // Split on sentence endings
    .split('|')
    .map(s => s.trim())
    .filter(s => s.length > 0);

  return sentences;
}
```

**Features:**

- Handles multiple sentence ending punctuation (.!?)
- Maintains sentence boundaries
- Filters empty sentences

### 3. Term Frequency (TF) Calculation

```typescript
private computeTF(words: string[]): Record<string, number> {
  const tf: Record<string, number> = {};
  const total = words.length;

  words.forEach(word => {
    tf[word] = (tf[word] || 0) + 1;
  });

  // Normalize by total word count
  Object.keys(tf).forEach(word => {
    tf[word] = tf[word] / total;
  });

  return tf;
}
```

**Formula:** `TF(word) = (Number of times word appears in sentence) / (Total words in sentence)`

### 4. Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) Calculation

```typescript
private computeIDF(sentences: string[][]): Record<string, number> {
  const N = sentences.length;
  const df: Record<string, number> = {};

  // Count document frequency for each word
  sentences.forEach(words => {
    const uniqueWords = new Set(words);
    uniqueWords.forEach(word => {
      df[word] = (df[word] || 0) + 1;
    });
  });

  // Compute IDF for each word
  const idf: Record<string, number> = {};
  Object.keys(df).forEach(word => {
    idf[word] = Math.log(N / df[word]);
  });

  return idf;
}
```

**Formula:** `IDF(word) = log(Total sentences / Number of sentences containing the word)`

### 5. Sentence Scoring

```typescript
private scoreSentences(sentences: string[], tokenizedSentences: string[][], idf: Record<string, number>) {
  return tokenizedSentences.map((words, index) => {
    const tf = this.computeTF(words);
    let score = 0;

    // Calculate TF-IDF score for each word in the sentence
    Object.keys(tf).forEach(word => {
      const tfidf = tf[word] * (idf[word] || 0);
      score += tfidf;
    });

    // Normalize by sentence length to avoid bias towards longer sentences
    score = score / Math.max(words.length, 1);

    return { sentence: sentences[index], score, index };
  });
}
```

**Formula:** `Sentence Score = Œ£(TF(word) √ó IDF(word)) / Sentence Length`
